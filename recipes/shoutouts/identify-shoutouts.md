# Identify Shoutouts

This recipe helps identify 2 shoutout opportunities based on recent feedback and achievements, formatted for the `#shoutouts` Slack channel.

## Goal

Generate 2 shoutouts following the Leadership Essentials framework, formatted appropriately for Slack's shoutouts channel.

## Context

### Framework from Leadership Essentials

The shoutout framework taught in Leadership Essentials:
- **Be specific** - describe what they did
- **Describe the impact** - highlight the impact of their actions
- **Lean into the 13 Behaviours of High Trust** - ensure feedback helps others reach their full potential

### Format Guidelines

Based on the `#shoutouts` channel style:
- Use Slack handles (`@username`) not full names
- Focus on **leadership and collaboration**, not just technical execution
- Keep it **concise and punchy** - remove technical details like ticket numbers
- Include **emojis/hashtags** at the end (common ones: `:makeithappen:`, `:makeenvatoproudnew:`, `:buildourfuture1:`, `:communityspiritnew:`)
- Don't mention trajectory toward senior/lead roles
- Capture the **full picture** including collaboration/alignment work, not just technical execution

## Task

1. **Review Recent Feedback** - Read the most recent feedback OUTPUT file
2. **Identify Shoutout Opportunities** - Look for achievements that demonstrate:
   - Leadership and ownership
   - Collaboration and team alignment
   - Impactful work delivery
   - System thinking and reliability
   - End-to-end ownership
3. **Draft 2 Shoutouts** - Write 2 shoutouts following the format guidelines

## Step 1: Review Recent Feedback

### Instructions

1. Find the most recent date-stamped directory in `feedback/` (e.g., `feedback/03-11-2025/`)
2. Read the `OUTPUT.md` file from that directory
3. Review the "Feedback ideas" sections for each team member
4. Look for achievements that would make good shoutouts:
   - Major deliverables or completions
   - Leadership moments (taking ownership, stepping up)
   - Collaboration and alignment work
   - System reliability improvements
   - End-to-end ownership examples

### What to Look For

**Good shoutout candidates:**
- Taking ownership of initiatives or handovers
- Leading testing and go-live processes
- Bringing teams into alignment
- Building durable solutions and guardrails
- System reliability thinking
- End-to-end delivery
- Collaboration and pairing work

**Avoid for shoutouts:**
- Trajectory mentions (e.g., "toward Senior Engineer")
- Technical ticket numbers (e.g., ATH-1532)
- Overly technical implementation details
- Concerns or areas for improvement

## Step 2: Draft Shoutouts

### Format Template

```
Shoutout to @username for [specific action/achievement]. [Impact description]. [Why it matters/leadership aspect]. :emoji1: :emoji2: :emoji3:
```

### Structure

1. **Opening**: "Shoutout to @username for..."
2. **Specific action**: What they did (focus on leadership/collaboration, not just technical)
3. **Impact**: What difference it made
4. **Why it matters**: Leadership aspect or broader significance
5. **Emojis**: 2-3 relevant emojis

### Common Emojis

- `:makeithappen:` - For execution and delivery
- `:makeenvatoproudnew:` - For achievements and quality work
- `:buildourfuture1:` - For system improvements and forward-thinking
- `:communityspiritnew:` - For collaboration and teamwork
- `:heart_decoration:` - For appreciation and recognition

### Examples

**Good Example:**
```
Shoutout to @ana.dj for stepping up to lead discrepancy management testing and go-live after Shannon's handover. You've shown real confidence and ownership, keeping testing on track and driving the launch forward. This is exactly the kind of end-to-end leadership that makes a difference. :makeithappen: :makeenvatoproudnew: :communityspiritnew:
```

**Good Example:**
```
Shoutout to @ai.bate for your excellent validation work across our data connectors. You tackled complex design challenges, brought the team into alignment, and delivered improvements that strengthen reliability and protect data integrity. You're thinking beyond the happy path and building durable guardrails. :makeithappen: :buildourfuture1: :makeenvatoproudnew:
```

**What makes these good:**
- Uses Slack handles
- Focuses on leadership and collaboration
- Describes impact clearly
- Concise and punchy
- Includes relevant emojis
- No technical ticket numbers
- No trajectory language

## Step 3: Review and Refine

### Checklist

Before finalizing, ensure each shoutout:
- [ ] Uses Slack handle (`@username`) not full name
- [ ] Focuses on leadership/collaboration, not just technical execution
- [ ] Is specific about what they did
- [ ] Describes the impact clearly
- [ ] Is concise (2-3 sentences)
- [ ] Includes 2-3 relevant emojis
- [ ] Doesn't include ticket numbers
- [ ] Doesn't mention trajectory toward roles
- [ ] Captures collaboration/alignment work if relevant

### Common Adjustments

**Too technical?** → Focus on leadership and impact instead
**Too long?** → Remove technical details, keep it punchy
**Missing collaboration?** → Add how they worked with others or brought teams together
**Too generic?** → Add specific details about what they did

## Output

Provide 2 shoutouts ready to post in the `#shoutouts` channel, formatted as shown in the examples above.

## Notes

- The shoutouts channel is for recognition and celebration
- Focus on what makes a difference, not just what was completed
- Leadership and collaboration are valued more than technical execution alone
- Keep it authentic and specific to what actually happened
