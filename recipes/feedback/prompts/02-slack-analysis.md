# Generate Slack Analysis Reports

## Goal
Generate individual Slack activity reports for each team member.

## Important: Read People Information First
**Before starting**, read the `recipes/people-info.md` file to get information about all team members.

## Task
For each team member:
1. Search for their recent Slack messages (last 7 days)
2. Analyze their communication patterns, contributions, and engagement
3. Note: Only look at messages since their last feedback entry
4. Generate insights about their work, collaboration, and communication

## Instructions
- Use Slack MCP tools to search messages for each person
- Focus on messages from the past week (or since last feedback entry from current-doc.md)
- Analyze:
  - Communication frequency and quality
  - Technical contributions
  - Collaboration patterns
  - Areas of focus and interest
  - Any notable achievements or concerns

## Output Format
For each person, create `feedback/dd-mm-yyyy/slack-{firstname}.md` with:
- Summary of activity
- Key messages and contributions
- Communication patterns
- Noteworthy discussions or achievements
- Any concerns or areas for improvement
