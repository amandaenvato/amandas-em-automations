    * **Encourage him to delegate or timebox manual tasks (affiliate extractions, ad hoc support) to protect focus on leadership and system-level reliability.**
    * **Reinforce value in shaping audit/ops learnings into reusable team practices or automation.**
    * **Reflect on how to use these compliance-heavy cycles as coaching opportunities for others.**
  * **Feedback given:**
    * **Chat about manual tasks / audit and if we are ready to delegate or automate. Not yet as things have changed**
* **Ana**
  * Expectations:
    * Deliver the Author Discrepancies system end-to-end, ensuring reliable data import and processing from Trolley into Author Warehouse.
    * Maintain stability in item performance features and production scheduling.
    * Continue building independence and confidence in debugging and cross-service troubleshooting.
  * Trajectory:
    * Moving toward Senior Engineer expectations: stronger stakeholder communication, more proactive technical design input.
    * Needs to build confidence in engaging with sprint priorities and making her asks clear when sharing.
    * Strengthening ownership of complex backend systems (finance, discrepancies, integrations).

    * Implemented and migrated Author Discrepancies data product; designed new schema and handled transformations.
    * Completed and refined item performance rake tasks through multiple follow-ups and production testing.
    * Resolved OpenSSL compatibility issues through version management and Ruby reinstallation.

    * Contributed to architecture discussions on discrepancy handling, Tailwind configuration, and data reliability between services.
    * Investigated complex IDV issues involving author business profiles.
    * Participated actively in in-person team activities during Queensland meetup.
  * Outcomes:
    * Author Discrepancies system implemented and integrated with Trolley data flow.
    * Visible engagement in design and review processes, supporting team-level consistency.
  * **Feedback ideas:**
    * **Acknowledge strong delivery of discrepancies and item performance work — persistence and technical depth paying off.**
    * **Encourage reflection on how to make problem-solving processes more predictable (e.g. reducing 3–4 PR cycles per feature).**
    * **Reinforce value of her technical reviews and contributions to architecture discussions — these signal readiness for senior-level thinking.**
    * **Support continued focus on communication clarity and proactively surfacing blockers, especially as she takes on more cross-service work.**
  * **Feedback given:**
    * **Check in on communication clarity**
    * **Reinforced value of her technical reviews and contributions to architecture discussions**

* **Niko**
  * Expectations:
    * Stabilise Storybook path forward: close PIR actions for the video uploader incident and prevent recurrence.
    * Improve staging test hygiene and change isolation across shared environments.
    * Organise Offboarding close out
  * Trajectory:
    * Senior to Lead: shift from hands-on fixes to durable safeguards and delegated execution.
    * Increase visibility by proactively surfacing risks, decisions, and tradeoffs.
  * Behaviours:
    * Rolled back Storybook v9 after production breakage of the video uploader (Oct 3–7). Opened and led PIR, coordinated ticket triage with Support, restored Zendesk access.
    * Ran offboarding tests in staging, identified that offboarded authors still retain non-upload rights in Market. Triggered a staging outage by disabling a canary portfolio, then investigated impact and recovery.
    * Shipped PRs on author state validation and IDV warning text. Fixed spec naming issues and improved CSV metadata handling.
    * Active in code reviews, shoutouts, and failure demand reflection.
  * Outcomes:
    * Production uploader restored and PIR in progress with clear actions.
    * New risks documented: Market non-upload access for offboarded authors, staging blast radius from shared flags and canary assets.
    * Continued progress on offboarding validation.
  * **Feedback ideas:**
    * **Delegate follow-on fixes where possible, keep context and decision logs visible to reduce single-holder risk.**
    * **Use the PIR to add a durable playbook entry: owner, prevention steps, monitoring, verification steps, exit criteria.**
    * **Focus on goals. No progress on offboarding close out in a month**
  * **Feedback given:**
    * **No progress on offboarding close out in a month**
    * **(limited \- spent time explaining team move)**
* **Ai**

    * Own verification expiry runs end to end: safe execution, monitoring, and clear comms with Engagement.
    * Keep production releases smooth while handling long running jobs and access constraints.
  * Trajectory:
    * Growing from strong executor to system owner: translate deep operational work into durable guardrails, documentation, and automation.
    * Strengthen promotion signals through concise framing of complex work and proactive risk surfacing.
  * Behaviours:
    * Ran Cohort 1 verification expiry on Oct 15 for 1,826 authors, coordinated access approvals, monitored the long running rake.

  * Outcomes:
    * Verification expiry delivered on time with monitored execution.
  * **Feedback ideas:**
    * Codify the verification expiry playbook: dry run steps, rate limits, success criteria, dashboards, rollback, owner list, comms template.
      * Convert recent fixes into reusable team patterns: long job runner guidance when sox executor is unsuitable, access request template, deploy window checklist.
    * Keep practicing concise explain-first updates: one paragraph summary, then details or diagrams linked.
  * **Feedback given:**
    * **Reflected on recent explanations**
