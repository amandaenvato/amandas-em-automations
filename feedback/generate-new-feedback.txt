I want to prepare a new entry for my document in gdrive called "Feedback To Reports"
If you read it you will be able to see that I think about each of my reports in turn and look at their expectations, their trajectory, etc.

Do this is by completing the following:

# read the doc
- Read the current document in google drive to get the most up to date information

# look at slack
- Gathering recent slack messages by that person
- Looking at the sub set of those messages that were sent since the last feedback entry (usually 1 week)

# look in jira
- Search jira for recently completed work items in the ATH project

# write a new entry
- Thinking about what I can write in each section including feedback ideas
- Note that Outcomes should be things the person seems to have done in response to previous feedback given
- Note that the "Feedback given:" should remain blank as I will fill that in when I actually give them feedback
