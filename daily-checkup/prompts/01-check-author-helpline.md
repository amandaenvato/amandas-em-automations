# Check Author Helpline

Check the #author-helpline Slack channel for unaddressed issues from the last few days.

## Instructions

1. Search the #author-helpline channel for messages from the last 3 days
2. Look for messages that don't have green tick emojis (✅) or Jira emojis (:jira:) indicating they've been addressed
3. For each unaddressed issue:
   - Provide a direct Slack link to the message
   - Summarize the issue briefly
   - Note if there's been discussion in the thread or if it remains unanswered
4. Give a summary count of unaddressed issues

## Expected Output

Provide direct feedback in conversation format with:
- Direct Slack links to unaddressed issues
- Brief summaries of each issue
- Discussion status (has replies vs unanswered)
- Total count of unaddressed issues

Do not create any documents - just provide the information directly in the conversation.
